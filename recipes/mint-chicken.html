    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A favorite family recipe that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests.
        Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a must! Serve over hot cooked white rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, 
            and shake off excess.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. 
            Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. 
            Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.
        </li>
    </ol>
